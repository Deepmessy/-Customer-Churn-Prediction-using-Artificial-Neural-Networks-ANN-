# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
## Introduction
### This repository contains code and documentation for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that predicts customer churn. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a product or service offered by a company. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Dataset
### The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing historical customer data. The dataset includes features such as customer demographics, Age, Credit Score, customer Gender, Estimated Salary and other relevant information. The target variable is a binary flag indicating whether a customer churned (1) or not (0).
